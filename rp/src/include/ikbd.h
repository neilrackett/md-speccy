 * Description: IKBD keyboard + joystick ingest + demux.
 *
 * The m68k Timer-B IKBD handler (target/atarist/src/userfw.s) reads
 * the keyboard ACIA at $FFFFFC00/02 and forwards every received byte
 * to the RP via a single cart-bus read at IKBD_WINDOW_BASE + byte in
 * the ROM3 region ($FB8200..$FB82FF, md-devops single-byte ABI).
 *
 * `ikbd_consume_rom3_sample(addr_lsb)` is passed directly as the
 * callback to `commemul_poll` in the emul.c main loop, filters for
 * the 256 B IKBD window, and pushes the low byte into a 64-entry
 * raw-byte ring.
 *
 * `ikbd_pump()` drains the raw-byte ring on the main loop and
 * classifies each byte statelessly:
 *   $00..$7F → key press scancode (scancode 0 suppressed)
 *   $80..$F1 → key release scancode (byte & $7F)
 *   $F2..$FF → packet headers for mouse / joystick / status / TOD.
 *              Mouse and joystick are disabled at IKBD boot ($12
 *              and $1A), so these shouldn't arrive in steady state.
 *              Discarded as single bytes; any leaked follow bytes
 *              may emit one-shot spurious key events.
 *
 * Apps drain decoded key events via `ikbd_pop_key`. ESC (scancode
 * $01) press+release within 200 ms triggers CMD_BOOT_GEM via the
 * cart command sentinel to exit userfw cleanly.
 *
 * Mouse and joystick decoding were both attempted but
 * proved unreliable (same byte-loss / demux-desync class of bug)
 * and are deferred.
 * Apps that want them can drop the $12 / $1A IKBD commands in
 * userfw.s and add their own packet-emit branches in this demux.

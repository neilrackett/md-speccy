/**
 * File: audio.h
 * Description: Cart-shared audio buffer producer + app-facing API.
 *
 * The m68k Timer-B IRQ (target/atarist/src/userfw.s) reads sample
 * bytes from a 1024-byte cart buffer at CART_AUDIO_BUFFER_OFFSET
 * and writes them to YM2149 volume registers. The RP refills the
 * "fresh" prefix of the buffer once per VBL via audio_render_frame()
 * (paced to ~50 Hz via time_us_32).
 *
 * Apps install audio content one of two ways:
 *
 *   1. audio_play_loop(data, bytes) -- convenience wrapper. The
 *      library installs a built-in callback that loops the given
 *      static buffer indefinitely. Typical use case for a baked-in
 *      jingle or sound effect.
 *
 *   2. audio_set_fill_callback(cb) -- low-level. The library
 *      invokes `cb(buf, bytes)` once per VBL refill with
 *      `bytes` set to the m68k's per-VBL consumption rate; the
 *      callback writes exactly that many bytes into `buf`. Use for
 *      streaming sources (e.g. SD-backed PCM).
 *
 * Sample format is whatever the m68k Timer-B handler expects --
 * the default handler in userfw.s reads 2 bytes per sample
 * (vA, vB) in dual-channel Ghostbusters-LUT mode. The library is
 * format-agnostic; it just copies bytes into the cart buffer.
 *
 * If no callback is installed, audio_render_frame() is a no-op and
 * the cart buffer stays whatever audio_init() left it (zero =
 * silence). Calling audio_set_fill_callback(NULL) re-enters this
 * silent state.

 *
 * The library opens the file, validates the header, and installs a
 * callback that reads from the file on every per-VBL refill. SD is
 * assumed mounted; call after sdcard_initFilesystem(). The file
 * loops at EOF (cursor wraps back to the data start).
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, negative on failure (open failed / short
 * read / bad magic / rate mismatch / unsupported mode). On failure
 * the previously installed callback is preserved -- apps can use
 * this to fall back to a baked-in audio_play_loop(). */
